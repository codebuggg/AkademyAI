# Machine Learning Practice

![alt text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8Ud_iFVUAA_mr4.jpg)

This repository contains a series of exercises for practicing your Machine Learning skills, under the form of self-correcting [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

- Associated examples can be found in the [Machine Learning Handbook](https://github.com/bpesquet/machine-learning-handbook) repository.
- Class slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OaYTXepuhoJFtB-Vq6SrHEXLPlsnOc0Nn9npx_lz500/edit?usp=sharing)
- Make sure to use [slack](https://akademyai.slack.com/) in the #Barcelona_1 Channel
- Please try to work with you **assigned pair_programming partners** assigned during the week.

### Classification Exersice
Given a dataset, make a program using the sklearn library, that divides the dataset in two parts, one for training and another for testing and train a classification algorithm of your choice from Sklearn (like SVM_Classification) to correctly classify the dataset. The datasets are available directly in the sklearn library. 

1.- Iris dataset (load_iris)
2.- Wine dataset (load_wine)


### Regression Exercise
Given the Boston dataset (load_boston), do a program using the library sklearn, that divides the dataset in two parts (one for training and another one for testing) and train the algorithm of regression to predict the housing prices given the missing values. 

## Available to review (from past class livepractice)
