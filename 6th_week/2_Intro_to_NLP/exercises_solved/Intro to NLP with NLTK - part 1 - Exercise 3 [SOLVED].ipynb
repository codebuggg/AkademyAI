    "As we can notice, returning the first word with the smallest edit distance can result in a wrong correction of the word: there are multiple words with the same edit distance to 'soemthing', so our spelling corrector is not that accurate. This problem may be solved in two ways:\n",
    "1. Return a list of all the words with the same edit distance, in this case we should be able to get the correct word, together with the other words with the same distance\n",
    "2. Using another method to compute the distance between words. If we want our spelling corrector to return only one word, we could improve it by analyzing the context in which the word appears, so that if a word has multiple corrections with the same distance, we can choose the one which can better fit in the context of the text.\n",

One way to make it less time consuming would be to consider only the words from the English list that have a similar length to the one of the word we are trying to correct."
