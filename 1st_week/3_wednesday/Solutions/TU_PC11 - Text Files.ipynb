    "One of the most important uses of Python for data processing is the reading, changing, and writing of text files. Data is often stored in text files, because text files can be easily transferred between different programs. There are multiple standardized formats for text files, such as \"comma-separated values\" (CSV) files. Python supports particular text file formats through modules, some of which will be discussed later. This chapter focusses on opening, reading, writing, and closing of any text file, regardless of format. "

    "When programmers refer to \"text files\" or \"flat text files\", they mean files in which all characters are meant to be read as regular characters, like you would type on a keyboard. For instance, Python program files are flat text files, as are HTML files. Word processor documents, however, are not flat text files, and neither are images. If you want to know whether a file is a text file or not, you can try to open it in a text editor (such as the editor for the IDLE environment, which comes with Python). If you see only readable text, the file is likely to be a text file. Otherwise, it is a so-called \"binary file\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files consist of lines of text. At the end of a line, there is a \"newline\" symbol, which in Python is the character \"`\\n`\". Different operating systems use slightly different ways of storing this character in a text file: some Windows programs store it as \"carriage return\", as well as \"line feed\" (\"`\\r\\n`\", sometimes thought as a leftover from old typewriters), while on Linux it is always stored as a single \"`\\n`\". As long as you access a file from Python as a regular text file, Python will convert the characters that it reads to the standard \"`\\n`\", and vice versa when it writes. So you do not usually need to worry about such differences (except when you need to transfer text files between operating systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "However; if you open a file in other editors, such as notepad, sometimes it does not properly understand the end-of-line characters, and shows everything on one line."

    "When you work with a file in a program, you have to open the file. Opening a file provides a so-called \"file handle\". A file handle can be seen as an access point to the file. It contains a \"pointer\" that indicates a particular place in the file. That pointer is used when you read from or write to the file. For instance, when you read from the file, it starts reading at the pointer, and moves the pointer forward in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file, the pointer is placed at a particular spot in the file, depending on how you opened the file. If you opened the file for reading only, the pointer is placed at the start of the file. The same is true when you open the file for both reading and writing. If you open the file for \"appending\" (i.e., to place new data at the file's end), the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. Lastly, if you open a file for writing only, actually the file is completely emptied and the file pointer is placed at the start of the, now empty, file. To create a new file (i.e., a file with a name that does not exist yet), you open it for \"writing only\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After opening the file, the file handle is the only access point for the file. All actions you perform on the file, you perform as methods for the file handle.\n",
    "\n",

    "The file pointer, that indicates where in a file you are working, is moved automatically. For instance, when you read 10 characters from a file, the file pointer indicates which is the first of those 10 characters, and, while reading, moves up 10 characters, so that its new position is 10 characters further in the file than before. When you deal with text files, the automatic movements of the file pointer are exactly what you want. You *can* position the file pointer manually using specific methods, but such methods are, in general, only used when dealing with binary files. "

    "When you make changes to files, these often are not stored in the files immediately. Instead, the operating system \"buffers\" the changes in memory, and \"flushes\" the buffers to the actual files when it sees a need for that. You can force the flushing of the buffers by closing a file. Buffers are also flushed when your program ends normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when your program crashes (for instance because of a runtime error), buffers might not be flushed, and your files will not be updated to the point where the crash took place. So you cannot take the file contents into account when trying to debug a program."

    "Most programs that deal with text files follow a process that, in a loop, reads contents of a file, processes those contents in some way, then writes the contents to another file. For instance, a program might read lines from a text file, and for each line sort the words, then write the sorted words to another text file. This is hardly any different from a program that asks the user the provide, in a loop, a line of text, then sorts the words in the line, and displays them using the `print()` function. \n",

    "\n",

That way, your insight in the inner workings of the program is no different regardless whether you use manual inputs and screen outputs, or file inputs and outputs."

      "reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested\n",
      "by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered\n",
      "him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from\n",
      "each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended\n",
      "a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his\n",
      "waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too\n",
      "much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the\n",
      "recess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\n",
      "nitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_ you to\n",
      "return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render\n",
      "you all the little attentions in my power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I\n",
      "have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of\n",
      "building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my\n",
      "trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered\n",
      "that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\n",
      "earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\n",
      "of the recess. It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\n",
      "long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and\n",
      "the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The\n",
      "noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\n",
      "it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the\n",
      "bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and\n",
      "finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\n",
      "tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again\n",
      "paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\n",
      "feeble rays upon the figure within.\n",
      "\n",
      "A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\n",
      "throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a\n",
      "brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to\n",
      "grope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant reassured\n",
      "me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt\n",
      "satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him\n",
      "who clamored. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in\n",
      "strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed\n",
      "the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion\n",
      "of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to\n",
      "be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it\n",
      "partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the\n",
      "niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded\n",
      "by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the\n",
      "noble Fortunato. The voice said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We\n",
      "will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over\n",
      "our wine--he! he! he!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting\n",
      "late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato\n",
      "and the rest? Let us be gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n",

      "\"_For the love of God, Montressor!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I\n",
      "called aloud--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fortunato!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer. I called again--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fortunato!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let\n",
      "it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.\n",
      "My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I\n",
      "hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its\n",
      "position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the\n",
      "old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed\n",

      "\n",
      "THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but\n",
      "when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the\n",
      "nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to\n",
      "a threat. _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitively\n",
      "settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,\n",
      "precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with\n",
      "impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its\n",
      "redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make\n",
      "himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given\n",
      "Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to\n",
      "smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at\n",
      "the thought of his immolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was\n",
      "a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his\n",
      "connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\n",
      "For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and\n",
      "opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian\n",
      "_millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,\n",
      "was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this\n",
      "respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in the\n",
      "Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\n",
      "carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with\n",
      "excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He\n",
      "had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted\n",
      "by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I\n",
      "thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably\n",
      "well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes\n",
      "for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\" said he. \"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of\n",
      "the carnival!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Whither?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To your vaults.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you\n",
      "have an engagement. Luchesi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no engagement;--come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which\n",
      "I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are\n",
      "encrusted with nitre.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You\n",
      "have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry\n",
      "from Amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask\n",
      "of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I\n",
      "suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in\n",
      "honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the\n",
      "morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.\n",
      "These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate\n",
      "disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,\n",
      "bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into\n",
      "the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him\n",
      "to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the\n",
      "descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the\n",
      "Montresors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled\n",
      "as he strode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pipe,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which gleams\n",
      "from these cavern walls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\n",
      "distilled the rheum of intoxication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nitre,\" I replied. \"How long have you had that cough?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!\n",
      "ugh! ugh!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is\n",
      "precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as\n",
      "once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will\n",
      "go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is\n",
      "Luchesi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I\n",
      "shall not die of a cough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming\n",
      "you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of\n",
      "this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of\n",
      "its fellows that lay upon the mould.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me\n",
      "familiarly, while his bells jingled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I to your long life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forget your arms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent\n",
      "rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the motto?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew\n",
      "warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with\n",
      "casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the\n",
      "catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato\n",
      "by an arm above the elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The nitre!\" I said: \"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the\n",
      "vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle\n",
      "among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on. But first, another draught of\n",
      "the Medoc.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath.\n",
      "His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle\n",
      "upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I,\" I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not of the masons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" I said, \"yes, yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You? Impossible! A mason?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A mason,\" I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sign,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\n",
      "my _roquelaire_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"But let us proceed to\n",
      "the Amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again\n",
      "offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route\n",
      "in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,\n",
      "descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in\n",
      "which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than\n",
      "flame.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\n",
      "spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\n",
      "vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three\n",
      "sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From\n",
      "the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon\n",
      "the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall\n",
      "thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still\n",
      "interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height\n",
      "six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use\n",
      "in itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal\n",
      "supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their\n",
      "circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to\n",
      "pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did\n",
      "not enable us to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\n",
      "forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had\n",
      "reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested\n",
      "by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered\n",
      "him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from\n",
      "each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended\n",
      "a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his\n",
      "waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too\n",
      "much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the\n",
      "recess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\n",
