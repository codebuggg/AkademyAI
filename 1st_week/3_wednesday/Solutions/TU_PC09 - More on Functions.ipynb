    "- You may need a particular functionality in your code that you need to control using parameters. If you put it in a function, the parameters become clearer and the code becomes more readable and easy to maintain.\n",
    "- Your program may just be getting too long to keep a solid grasp on its contents, and you feel you can improve readability and maintainability by splitting off inherently connected blocks into functions.\n",
    "- You may have problems solving a big problem in one go, and decide to divide it into sub-problems (which is usually a good idea). You can now create a function for each of these sub-problems, and by connecting them together, solve the big problem.\n",
    "- Your program may contain deeply nested conditions or loops, and would benefit enormously as far as readability is concerned by moving some of the deeper nestings into functions.\n",
    "- You may want to re-use code in different programs, and functions are a good way to transfer code between programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "A function is like a big machine, for instance, a machine that makes pancakes. It has some input hoppers at the top, which are labeled \"milk\", \"eggs\", and \"flour\". Those are the input parameters. You can decide what pancakes you want by putting the right stuff in the hoppers; for instance, if you want whole-grain pancakes, you put whole-grain flour into the \"flour\" hopper. Of course, you can be certain that things will go dramatically wrong if you put eggs into the \"milk\" hopper -- or you try to put a cat into the \"flour\" hopper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, once the hoppers are loaded the machine starts huffing and puffing. You patiently wait next to the output hopper which, surprise surprise, is labeled \"return\". And after a short while, a pancake slides out. The pancake is the return value that the machine produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine also has a display. Maybe after you put something inappropriate into the \"flour\" hopper, the display says: \"Cat stuck in the machine, please reset\". The display is where everything that you \"print\" in the machine appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you understand that it is useless if, after loading the right ingredients into the input hopper, the machine just displays \"Pancake is ready!\" You want the actual pancake. That's why the machine must \"return\" it via its output hopper, from which you can take it and \"assign\" it to your lunch plate. Just printing that the pancake exists is not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, one of the nice things about the pancake making machine is that even if you do not know how pancakes are made, you can still get pancakes as long as you manage to supply the right ingredients. That's also what is so nice about functions: they may do complex things for you without you needing to know how they accomplish them."

While programming courses often encourage students to write comments in code, I myself am of the opinion that code should be \"self-documenting\", i.e., that you can easily derive from code what it does simply by reading it. You can accomplish that often by choosing strong names for variables and functions, judiciously using whitespaces and empty lines, good indenting (which Python enforces), and not using any convoluted trickery just because it makes the code a little bit faster or to show off how smart you are.\n",

Therefore, what the function does and how it works, should be explained in comments at the top of the function, above the function name.\n",

However, there are functions that work only on a particular data type, and are defined in such a way that a variable of that data type has to be placed in front of the function call, with a period in between. The reason why this is, has to do with something called \"object orientation\", which I will discuss much later in this course. For now, just know that such functions are called \"methods\", and to call them, you have to place the variable of the right data type in front of them, with a period in between.
