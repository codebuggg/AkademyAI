    "Here is the crux: `print()` has *no* return value, so there is nothing that Python can use for `<something>`. For situations such as this, Python has a special value called `None`. So the first `print()` gets called with `None` as argument, and this leads to Python displaying the word \"None\". \n",

    "`None` is a special value that indicates \"no value at all\". If you try to print such a value, Python prints the word `None`, but is not actually printing a string that is \"None\". It only indicates that there was nothing to print. `None` is different from, for instance, an empty string (`\"\"`). An empty string is still a value, namely a string of length zero. `None` is no string at all, no integer, no float, nothing. So be careful when trying to use a function call as a parameter; if the function does not actually return a value, weird things may happen."

    "- `random()` gets no parameters, and returns a random float in the range `[0,1)`, i.e., a range that includes `0.0`, but excludes `1.0`.\n",
    "- `randint()` gets two parameters, both integers, and the first should be smaller than or equal to the second. It returns a random integer in the range for which the two parameters are boundaries, e.g., `randint(2,5)` returns 2, 3, 4, or 5, with an equal chance for each of them.\n",
    "- `seed()` initializes the random number generator of Python. If you want a sequence of random numbers that are always the same for your program, start by calling `seed` with a fixed value as parameter, for instance, `0`. This can be useful for testing purposes. If you want to re-initialize the random number generator so that it starts behaving completely randomly again, call `seed()` without parameter.\n",
