    "Python offers some basic functions, some of which are introduced in previous exercises. Besides those, Python offers a large assortment of so-called \"modules\", which contain many more useful functions. To use functions from a module in your program, you have to `import` the module, by write a line `import <modulename>` at the top of your code. You can then use all the functions in the module, though you have to precede the function calls with the name of the module and a period, e.g., to call the `sqrt()` function from the `math` module (which calculates the square root of a number), you call `math.sqrt()` after importing `math`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can import only specific functions from a module, by stating `from <modulename> import <functioname1>, <functionname2>, <functionname3>, ...`. The main advantage of importing specific functions from a module in this way is that in your code, you no longer need to precede the call to a function with the module name.\n",
