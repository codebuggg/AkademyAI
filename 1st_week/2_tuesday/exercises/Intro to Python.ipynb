    "- Programmers <i>never</i> choose variable names that are also the names of functions (whether they are functions provided by Python or functions they wrote themselves). Doing so will cause the corresponding function to be no longer accessible by the code, and may then lead to rather eccentric errors.\n",
    "- Programmers try to choose variable names that are in some way meaningful to the code. For instance, a variable that stores the number of seconds in a week, might have the name `secs_per_week`, but not the name `i_hate_my_job`. It would be even worse to name a variable that contains the numbers of seconds in a week `secs_per_month`.\n",
    "- An exception to choosing meaningful variable names is choosing names for \"throw-away\" variables, i.e., variables that you only use in a very small section of the code and that are no longer needed afterwards, and that have no good meaning by themselves. Programmers usually choose a single-letter name for such variables. For instance, if a variable is needed to quickly count to 100, after which it is not needed anymore, programmers often choose the letter `i` or `j` for such a variable. \n",
    "- To avoid confusion with capitals and lower case letters, programmers tend to use only lower case letters in variable names.\n",
    "- If a variable name is chosen that consists of multiple words, programmers put one underscore between each of the words.\n",
    "- Programmers never choose variable names that start with an underscore. Such variable names are considered reserved for the authors of the Python interpreter.\n",

    "In Python, __correct indenting is of the utmost importance__! Without correct indentation, Python will not be able to recognize which statements belong together as one code block, and therefore cannot execute your code correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note**: In many programming languages (actually, in almost all programming languages), code blocks are recognized by having them start and end with a specific symbol or keyword. For instance, in languages such as Java and C++, code blocks are enclosed by curly brackets, while in languages such as Pascal and Modula, code blocks are started with the keyword `begin` and ended with the keyword `end`. That means that in almost all languages, indenting to recognize code blocks is not necessary. However, you will find that code written by capable programmers is always nicely indented, regardless of the language. This makes it easy to see which code belongs together, for instance, which commands belong to an `if` statement. Python makes indenting a requirement. While for experienced programmers who are new to Python this seems strange at first, they quickly find that they do not care -- they were indenting nicely anyway, and Python's strategy makes that beginning programmers are also required to write nice-looking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can indent using the *Tab* key, or indent using spaces. Most editors (including the editor in these notebooks) will auto-indent for you, i.e., if, for instance, you write the first line of an `if` statement, once you press *Enter* to go to the next line, it will automatically \"jump in\" one level of indentation (if it does not, it is very likely that you forgot the colon at the end of the conditional expression). Also, when you have indented one line to a certain level of indentation, the next line will use the same level. You can get rid of indentations using the *Backspace* key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python programs, a normal level of indentation is four spaces, i.e., one press of the *Tab* key should \"jump in\" four spaces. As long as you are in one editor, you can in such a case either use the *Tab* key, or press the spacebar four times, to go up one indentation level. So far so good. You may get into problems, however, if you port your code to another editor, which might have a different setting for the *Tab* key. If you edit your code in a such a different editor, even though it might look okay, Python may see that there are indentation conflicts (a mix of tabulations and space-indentations) and may report a syntax error when you try to run your code. Most editors therefore offer the option to automatically replace tabulations with spaces, so that such problems do not arise. If you use a text editor to write Python code, check if it contains such an option, and if so, ensure that tabulations are set to 4 and are automatically replaced by spaces."

The reason that this happens is that there is an invisible character included at the end of each line in the second example that indicates that Python should move to the next line before continuing.

We use ten (`0` to `9`), binary uses two (`0` to `1`), and hexidecimal then uses `0` to `9` and then continues from `A` to `F`. A direct translation from hexadecimals to decimals turns `A` into `10`, `B` into `11`, etcetera. In decimal counting, the value of a multi-digit number is found by multiplying the digits by increasing powers of `10`, from right to left, e.g., the number `1426` is `6 + 2*10 + 4*100 + 1*1000`. For hexadecimal numbers you do the same thing, but multiply by powers of `16`, e.g., the hexadecimal number `4AF2` is `2 + 15*16 + 10*256 + 4*4096`. Programmers tend to like hexadecimal numbers, as computers work with bytes as the smallest unit of memory storage, and a byte can store 256 different values, i.e., any byte value can be expressed by a hexadecimal number of two digits.
